# Compile the project that contains the current directory.
# The exit status is the result of the build if a buildfile exists,
# otherwise 0 (success) unless ERR_IF_NO_BUILDFILE is set to a non-empty value
# Usage:
#   compile-project
#
# Supports Gradle, Maven, and Make projects.
# If variable GRADLE_ASSEMBLE_FLAGS is defined, it is passed to `gradle assemble`.
# If variable MVN_COMPILE_FLAGS is defined, it is passed to `mvn compile`.
# If variable MAKE_FLAGS is defined, it is passed to `make`.
# If variable ERR_IF_NO_BUILDFILE is non-empty, the script fails if no buildfile is found.
#
# This command does not need to be run in the top-level directory of the project;
# it will discover the top-level directory on its own and run the command there.

# TODO: Handle other build systems too, such as Ant.
# TODO: Have a list of per-directory or per-repository commands, to override the default.
